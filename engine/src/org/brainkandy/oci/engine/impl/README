Known Behavioral Issues:

1. When Cartridge show characters above ASCII set, it shows damaged versions
of the standard character set. In the SWT sample, it throws an exception.
2. When a character is placed out of bounds, the behavior looks odd. In this case,
the output merely wraps around.
3. The cartridge requries a NOOP after three consecutive output statements. That
is not required for the emulator.
4. Curious: what do UNP.F and PAK.F do?
5. What does PAK do with 0 F? PAK 9 F? PAK A FF?
